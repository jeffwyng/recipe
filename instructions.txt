Steak Recipe
Heat the Pan: Use a heavy skillet (cast iron is ideal) over high heat. Add a high-smoke-point oil (like avocado or grapeseed) until it just begins to shimmer or smoke.
The Sear: Lay the steak away from you to avoid splashes. Sear for 2–3 minutes per side without moving it to build a deep, caramelized crust.
The Baste: Reduce heat to medium-low. Add 2–3 tablespoons of butter, 3 smashed garlic cloves, and fresh rosemary or thyme.
Finish: Tilt the pan and spoon the foaming, infused butter over the steak repeatedly for another 1–2 minutes.
